# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

I've developed a server for the WTWR (What to Wear?) application using Node.js and Express.js. I've utilized Postman for API testing and MongoDB Compass for database management, gaining hands-on experience with these essential tools in modern web development. This project has been instrumental in deepening my understanding of server-side programming and database interactions

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
